# Composables Notes for Agents

This directory wraps browser/platform APIs behind reusable Vue composables.

## Responsibilities

1. Encapsulate browser capability checks and fallbacks (media devices, push, SW registration).
2. Provide reactive, testable contracts to stores/views.
3. Keep side-effect boundaries clear (subscribe/unsubscribe, permission prompts, timers).

## Invariants

1. Push subscription logic must handle missing SW registration gracefully and surface actionable errors.
2. Browser permission states are best-effort and can change outside app control; re-check on open/focus flows.
3. Composables should not embed domain policy owned by backend (unread/notification authority).

## Change Guidance

1. Prefer feature detection over user-agent branching where possible.
2. Keep composable APIs narrow and explicit; return only state/actions required by callers.
3. When behavior changes affect UX-critical flows (push, session orchestration), update tests and user-facing error text together.
